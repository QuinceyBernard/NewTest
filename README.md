# Artificial Intolerance

## Introduction

> Currently, I am studying Digital Media in my final year at the University of West England and am required to research, develop and build a project over the span of the academic year. For my project, I looked into the ethical issues surrounding facial recognition and its issues with non-white male faces. Using Face-API.js to categorise the viewer by their gender and age classification (Millenial, Gen X, Baby Boomer). Depending on the categorisation of the viewer a specific documentary video is shown that aims to highlight the issues with the technology to the viewer through various ways.

## Live Demo 

> You can see a live demo of the project by visiting the following link: https://quinceybernard.github.io/Artificial-Intolerance/index.html

## Installation

> To use the current build on your own computer, simply download the full GitHub repository and run the full folder on a localhost server. I would recommend using  MAMP to run your localhost server. Ensure that your webcam is activated and you are within the frame of the camera.
